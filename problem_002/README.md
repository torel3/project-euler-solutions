## Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Approach

Generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.

Start with a = 1, b = 2.

Generate the next Fibonacci number as a, b = b, a + b.

If the number is even (n % 2 == 0), add it to the sum.

Stop when b exceeds 4,000,000.

## RunTime
