# Problem 6 - Sum Square Difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

$$
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

$$
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
$$

The difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum for the first ten natural numbers is:

$$
3025 - 385 = 2640
$$

Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum for the first 100 natural numbers.
